Notice that the neurons in the first hidden layer have learned simple patterns, while the neurons in the second hidden layer have learned to combine the simple patterns of the first hidden layer into more complex patterns). In general, the more layers, the more complex the patterns can be.\n",
    "* **Activation function**: try replacing the Tanh activation function with the ReLU activation function, and train the network again. Notice that it finds a solution even faster, but this time the boundaries are linear. This is due to the shape of the ReLU function.\n",
    "* **Local minima**: modify the network architecture to have just one hidden layer with three neurons. Train it multiple times (to reset the network weights, just add and remove a neuron). Notice that the training time varies a lot, and sometimes it even gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "* **Too small**: now remove one neuron to keep just 2. Notice that the neural network is now incapable of finding a good solution, even if you try multiple times. The model has too few parameters and it systematically underfits the training set.\n",
    "* **Large enough**: next, set the number of neurons to 8 and train the network several times. Notice that it is now consistently fast and never gets stuck. This highlights an important finding in neural network theory: large neural networks almost never get stuck in local minima, and even when they do these local optima are almost as good as the global optimum. However, they can still get stuck on long plateaus for a long time.\n",
    "* **Deep net and vanishing gradients**: now change the dataset to be the spiral (bottom right dataset under \"DATA\"). Change the network architecture to have 4 hidden layers with 8 neurons each. Notice that training takes much longer, and often gets stuck on plateaus for long periods of time. Also notice that the neurons in the highest layers (i.e. on the right) tend to evolve faster than the neurons in the lowest layers (i.e. on the left). This problem, called the \"vanishing gradients\" problem, can be alleviated using better weight initialization and other techniques, better optimizers (such as AdaGrad or Adam), or using Batch Normalization.\n",

    "There are many use cases in which having multiple outputs can be useful:\n",

    "* Similarly, you may have multiple independent tasks to perform based on the same data. Sure, you could train one neural network per task, but in many cases you will get better results on all tasks by training a single neural network with one output per task. This is because the neural network can learn features in the data that are useful across tasks.\n",
    "* Another use case is as a regularization technique (i.e., a training constraint whose objective is to reduce overfitting and thus improve the model's ability to generalize). For example, you may want to add some auxiliary outputs in a neural network architecture (as shown in the diagram) to ensure that that the underlying part of the network learns something useful on its own, without relying on the rest of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips**:\n",
    "* Building the model is pretty straightforward using the functional API. Just make sure you specify both outputs when creating the `keras.models.Model`, for example `outputs=[output, aux_output]`.\n",
    "* Each output has its own loss function. In this scenario, they will be identical, so you can either specify `loss=\"mse\"` (this loss will apply to both outputs) or `loss=[\"mse\", \"mse\"]`, which does the same thing.\n",
    "* The final loss used to train the whole network is just a weighted sum of all loss functions. In this scenario, you want most to give a much smaller weight to the auxiliary output, so when compiling the model, you must specify `loss_weights=[0.9, 0.1]`.\n",
    "* When calling `fit()` or `evaluate()`, you need to pass the labels for all outputs. In this scenario the labels will be the same for the main output and for the auxiliary output, so make sure to pass `(y_train, y_train)` instead of `y_train`.\n",
